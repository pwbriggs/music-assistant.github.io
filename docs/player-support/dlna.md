Music Assistant has support for uPnP/DLNA based devices. This is a (somewhat) universal standard for streaming audio to supported devices. Due to the very inconsistent implementation of this protocol by manufacturers, some players will work great and others will simply not work at all or need workarounds. Other than that, if you have a device that works, you can enjoy fast local control, lossless audio support and in many cases metadata of your playing media.

!!! danger "IMPORTANT"
    Due to the patchy implementation of the DLNA protocol among manufacturers the most likely working configuration is with the QUEUE FLOW MODE on. If you still have problems after ensuring this is enabled then try each of the different streaming profiles

## Features

- DLNA devices are auto detected in Music Assistant

## Known Issues / Notes

- Some devices need special workarounds to enable playback. If playback is not working, look at the Music Assistant logs for clues and report an issue with these logs provided. Unfortunately due to the difficulty in resolving these issues they are low priority. If your device supports a different protocol then use that instead of raising an issue
- If your device is not found then try turning on the option "allow network scan for discovery"
- DLNA speakers do not support crossfading of audio. If you want crossfade and/or full gapless support, [queue flow mode](../faq/normalization.md/#track-queueing) must be enabled in the player's settings. Enabling flow mode may solve playback issues however it might come with the side effect of disabling actual physical buttons and/or display of metadata on the device itself
- It is possible to group DLNA players via a [Universal Group](../faq/groups.md#universal-groups) although they may not play in sync
- Although Sonos devices are strictly also based on DLNA, they created their own extra layer on top of that such as crossfade support and many other goodies. It is therefore advised to use the Sonos Player provider with Music Assistant instead of the DLNA provider. MA disables any discovered Sonos DLNA devices by default
- In order to support a greater number of players, different streaming profiles are available. If the player doesn't work, stops mid stream or has other playback issues then change the player setting `HTTP Profile used for sending audio` and try each option until the player works
