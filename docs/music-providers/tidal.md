## Configuration

In the configuration, there are a series of steps that must be completed in order. Start at the top of the page and work down. 

    ![Tidal Config](../assets/screenshots/tidal-config.png){ width=800 }

1. Click on the first button and you will be redirected to the Tidal login page and after logging in you will be taken to an error page which is normal.

    ![Oops Page](../assets/screenshots/oops-page.png){ width=800 }

2. Take the full URL in the address bar of the Oops error page and insert it into the configuration screen  

3. Click on the last button to complete the setup
