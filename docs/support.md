**Before You Ask:**

Review how To [Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

Before asking a technical question in any of our support channels, please do the following:

1. Try to find an answer by searching this documentation and [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/music-assistant/discussions)
2. Try to find an answer by searching the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/music-assistant/hass-music-assistant/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
3. Try to find an answer by searching the Web: https://www.google.com/
4. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
5. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

When you ask your question, display the fact that you have done these things first; this will help establish that you're not being lazy and wasting people's time. Better yet, display what you have learned from doing these things. We like answering questions for people who have demonstrated they can learn from the answers.
