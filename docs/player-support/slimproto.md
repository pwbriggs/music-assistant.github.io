# Slimproto (a.k.a Squeezebox) ![Preview image](../assets/icons/slim-icon.svg){ width=70 align=right }


Music Assistant (partly) emulates a Logitech Media Server and has a full implementation of the Slim protocol (aka slimproto).
This means you can use squeezebox players directly with Music Assistant. This applies to the original Logitech branded Squeezebox hardware players like the Radio and the Duet and any software variants of it like squeezelite which runs on almost any hardware, including your own desktop OS and even ESP32 boards.

## Features

- Slimproto devices are auto detected in Music Assistant
- Slimproto devices will play in sync
- Any physical control buttons on the device should be supported as long as [flow mode](../faq/normalization.md/#track-queueing) is not enabled
- The player settings include some basic equaliser settings
- The player settings allow configuration of stereo pairs of speakers

## Known Issues / Notes

- Running LMS on the same server as MA with the MA slimproto provider enabled can have undesired effects
- Make sure that you do not have the "slimproto" integration running in Home Assistant
- Ordinarily do not use flow mode unless using older squeezebox hardware player that has issues transitioning. Enabling flow mode may solve playback issues however it might come with the side effect of disabling actual physical buttons and/or display of metadata on the device itself
