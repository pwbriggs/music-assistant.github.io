## Features

### [Squeezelite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezelite)

Squeezelite comes embedded in the application. This allows playback of music to your computer. The player name will be the same as your computer name. You can change the name in Music Assistant settings. You can also toggle if you wish to enable squeezelite at all.

To allow playback to the companion app you have to enable the slimproto provider in the Music Assistant settings.

### [Discord Rich Presence](https://discord.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to#so-what-is-it)

Like the Spotify app, the Music Assistant app can do Discord Rich Presence.
