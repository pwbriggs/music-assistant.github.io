## Architecture

Music Assistant consists of multiple building blocks:

- Music Assistant Server ([Installation Instructions](installation.md))
- Music Assistant Integration for Home Assistant ([Installation Instructions](integration/installation.md))
    - An optional sub-component of the Integraton is the Home Assistant Plugin for Music Assistant. This allows the importing of Home Assistant media players into the Music Assistant engine to use as targets for playback

## Music Assistant Server

The Music Assistant server is a free, opensource Media library manager that connects to your streaming services and a wide range of connected speakers. The server is the beating heart, the core of Music Assistant and it keeps track of your music sources. It must run on an always-on device like a Raspberry Pi, a NAS or an Intel NUC or alike. The server can access multiple music providers and stream to multiple player types.
